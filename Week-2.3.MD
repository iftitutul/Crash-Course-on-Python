## Boolean
Booleans represent one of two possible states, either true or false.

In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. 

- To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
- To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != 

We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > and <. If you try to compare data types that arenâ€™t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. 

## Logical Operators
Python also has a set of logical operators. These operators allow you to connect multiple statements together and perform more complex comparisons. In Python the logical operators are the words **and, or,** and **not**

- When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated must be true for the whole statement to be true. 
- When using the or operator, if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true. 
- Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False.
