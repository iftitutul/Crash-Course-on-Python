""" In Python, a dictionary can only hold a single value for a given key. To workaround this, our single value can be a list containing multiple values. Here we have a dictionary called "wardrobe" with items of clothing and their colors. Fill in the blanks to print a line for each item of clothing with each color, for example: "red shirt", "blue shirt", and so on. """
