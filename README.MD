# Crash Course on Python - GOOGLE (Coursera)

A computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do. The recipe is written in a code called programming language.
Programming languages are actually similar to humans spoken languages since they have a syntax and semantics.


`Paula loves to program in Python`
 
 as an example. In this sentence, Paula is the subject and loves to program in Python is the predicate. 
 
 To form a sentence that others can understand, you need to know both the syntax that constructs the sentence and the semantics that gives it meaning.

 When writing code, using correct syntax is super important. Even a small typo, like a missing parentheses or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. Yikes. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes.

If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Remember that syntax is the rules of how code is constructed, while semantics are the overall effect the code has. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.

# Python 
Python makes it easy to express the fundamental concepts of programming
like data structures and algorithms with easy to read syntax.
This makes Python a great language to use to learn programming.
