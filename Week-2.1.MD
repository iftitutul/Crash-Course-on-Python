## Data Type
Text written between quotes in Python is called a string. In programming terminology, a **string** is known as a **data type**, 

In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a TypeError. You can always check the data type of something using the type() function.

## Variables
Variables are names that we give to certain values in our programs.

An expression is a combination of numbers, symbols or other variables that produce a result when evaluated.

## Variable Nameing Restriction
- Don't use keywords or functions that Python reserves for its own
- Don't use spaces
- Must start with a letter or underscore(_)
- Must be made up for only letters, numbers and underscore (_)

## Implicit Conversion
The interpreter automatically converts one data type into another.

## Explicit conversion
In Python, to convert between one data type and another, we call a function with the name of the type we're converting to.
