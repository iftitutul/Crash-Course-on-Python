## String Indexing and Slicing

String indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. You can do this by using square brackets and the location, or index, of the character you want to access. It's important to remember that Python starts indexes at 0. So to access the first character in a string, you would use the index [0]. If you try to access an index that’s larger than the length of your string, you’ll get an **IndexError**. This is because you’re trying to access something that doesn't exist! You can also access indexes from the end of the string going towards the start of the string by using negative values. The index [-1] would access the last character of the string, and the index [-2] would access the second-to-last character.

You can also access a portion of a string, called a **slice** or **a substring**. This allows you to access multiple characters of a string. You can do this by creating a range, using a colon as a separator between the start and end of the range, like [2:5]. This range is similar to the range() function we saw previously. It includes the first number, but goes to one less than the last number. You can also easily reference the start or end of the string by leaving one value blank. For example [:5] would give us all characters from the start to the fourth character in the string. We can also use [5:] to get the characters from the fourth character to the end of the string.

## Basic String Methods

In Python, strings are immutable. This means that they can't be modified. So if we wanted to fix a typo in a string, we can't simply modify the wrong character. We would have to create a new string with the typo corrected. We can also assign a new value to the variable holding our string.

If we aren't sure what the index of our typo is, we can use the string method index to locate it and return the index. Let's imagine we have the string *"lions tigers and bears"* in the variable animals. We can locate the index that contains the letter g using *animals.index("g")*, which will return the index; in this case 8. We can also use substrings to locate the index where the substring begins. *animals.index("bears")* would return 17, since that’s the start of the substring. If there’s more than one match for a substring, the index method will return the first match. If we try to locate a substring that doesn't exist in the string, we’ll receive a **ValueError** explaining that the substring was not found.

We can avoid a ValueError by first checking if the substring exists in the string. This can be done using the **in** keyword. We saw this keyword earlier when we covered for loops. In this case, it's a conditional that will be either True or False. If the substring is found in the string, it will be True. If the substring is not found in the string, it will be False. Using our previous variable animals, we can do *"horses" in animals* to check if the substring "horses" is found in our variable. In this case, it would evaluate to **False**, since horses aren’t included in our example string. If we did *"tigers" in animals*, we'd get **True**, since this substring is contained in our string.
